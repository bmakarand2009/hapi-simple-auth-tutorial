Introduction
Hapi Js is a awesome framework, but there are not many tutorials out there.
This tutorial will walk throught adding BasicAuth to your login page.

urls
/login - GET will take you to Login page
POST - should login and take you to the securied page 

login.html is mapped to /login - this makes the /login URL public
while other pages are protected inside the server folder
